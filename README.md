# go-bookstore
This is my first project in GOLANG

### BOOK STORE
as the name suggests this project is a simple Rest API system for managing a bookstore or library.

here are some of the available endpoints

+ POST book       : yourdomain.com/book/
+ GET books       : yourdomain.com/book/
+ GET book by id  : yourdomain.com/book/{bookId}
+ PUT book        : yourdomain.com/book/{bookId}
+ DELETE boook    : yourdomain.com/book/{bookId}


sorry if the documentation is not good, I hope you have a nice day :smile:
